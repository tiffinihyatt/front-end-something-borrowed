## Application Features

### Create New Listing

Users can access photos from their camera roll to list a new item for sale. Listed items are posted to the app's database and appear in the application's "Browse" view.

### Add to Cart

Users can also view listing details and add items to their shopping cart. Adding an item to one's shopping cart toggles the item's availability and removes that item from the "Browse" view. When a user removes an item from their cart, the availability is toggled again and the item becomes visible in the "Browse" view.
